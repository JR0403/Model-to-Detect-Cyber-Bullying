# Model-to-Detect-Cyber-Bullying
This project develops an NLP-based cyberbullying detection system using Orange 3.39. Text data is preprocessed through tokenization, stop-word removal, and TF-IDF vectorization. A supervised learning model is trained to classify sentiment and detect bullying-related content from user messages.
